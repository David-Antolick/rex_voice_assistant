General setup notes (likely to be at least partially automated in the future)

Connecting audio (no idea if this would work vpn into server, probably not):
- download PulseAudio for windows (https://pgaskin.net/pulseaudio-win32/)
- Make sure to open private connections and whatever the second option is
- this should work with that then for audio streaming through default


Connecting to youtube music (desktop app, likely not adding browser functionality)
- Download here: https://ytmdesktop.app (github: https://github.com/ytmdesktop/ytmdesktop)
- go into settings (gear in the top right of app)
- enable 'companion server' and 'allow browser communication' + 'enable companion authorization'
- this SHOULD open up your ability to comunicate via port 9863 (the default)
- confrim using:
curl http://host.docker.internal:9863/metadata
-> { "apiVersions": ["v1"] }

Get one time code:
curl -X POST http://host.docker.internal:9863/api/v1/auth/requestcode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"appId":"rex_voice_assistant","appName":"Rex","appVersion":"1.0.0"}'
-> {'code': '1234'}

use code to get token:
curl -X POST http://host.docker.internal:9863/api/v1/auth/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"appId":"rex_voice_assistant","code":"THE_CODE_YOU_JUST_GOT"}'
-> { "token": "ea845423977fcbe9535547db2c09134b5087c352..." }

set token in a .env file with other info and you're all setup
